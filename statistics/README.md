## How to Generate These Statistics

To gather and update these statistics, you can use various tools:

- **Git Commands**:
  - To count commits:
    ```bash
    git rev-list --count HEAD
    ```
  - To list contributors:
    ```bash
    git shortlog -s -n
    ```
  - To count lines of code:
    ```bash
    git ls-files | xargs wc -l
    ```
- **GitHub Insights**:
  - Navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on the **Insights** tab to view graphs and statistics.
- **Third-Party Tools**:
  - **GitStats**: Generates HTML reports with statistics.
