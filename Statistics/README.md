# Statistics of Niryo One Robot Trials

This project compiles data from experiments where five participants (Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, Person 4, and Person 5) used the Niryo One robotic arm to perform tasks. The table below shows the results from ten trials per participant, along with their average scores. Niryo One is an advanced robotic arm commonly used for educational purposes, research, and the development of automated processes.

## Description of the Trials

Each participant completed ten separate trials, with their scores recorded based on how successfully and efficiently they operated the Niryo One robotic arm. The robotic arm is often used to simulate real-world applications in industry and education. The trials measured both precision and time efficiency, resulting in scores for each individual.

### Participant Analysis
- **Person 1** performed the best with the highest average score of **100.3**. Their results were consistently high in the early trials.
- **Person 2** came in second with an average score of **87.3**, showing strong results in the first three trials.
- **Person 3** had an average score of **77**, demonstrating steady performance with high scores at the beginning, followed by a decline towards the end.
- **Person 4** showed a lower average score of **62.3**, with peak performance in trial 7.
- **Person 5** scored the lowest with an average of **64.8**, possibly due to variability in their scores across trials.

## Conclusion

The results reveal a general trend of decreasing scores over time, which may indicate fatigue, increasing task difficulty, or challenges in maintaining precision with the robotic arm. Niryo One serves as a valuable platform for understanding and improving skills in robotics and automation.

## Future Work

- Conduct more trials with additional participants to create a larger dataset.
- Analyze the reasons behind the decline in scores and identify potential areas for improving user performance.
- Test other tasks with Niryo One to measure different aspects of user interaction.
