## Description of the Trials

Each participant completed ten separate trials, with their scores recorded based on how successfully and efficiently they operated the Niryo One robotic arm. The robotic arm is often used to simulate real-world applications in industry and education. The trials measured both precision and time efficiency, resulting in scores for each individual.

### Participant Analysis
- **Person 1** performed the best with the highest average score of **100.3**. Their results were consistently high in the early trials.
- **Person 2** came in second with an average score of **87.3**, showing strong results in the first three trials.
- **Person 3** had an average score of **77**, demonstrating steady performance with high scores at the beginning, followed by a decline towards the end.
- **Person 4** showed a lower average score of **62.3**, with peak performance in trial 7.
- **Person 5** scored the lowest with an average of **64.8**, possibly due to variability in their scores across trials.
