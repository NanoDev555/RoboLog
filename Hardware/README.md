## Overview

The RoboLog project aims to develop a prosthetic arm controlled through various sensor inputs to mimic natural human movements. The hardware setup includes a Niryo One robotic arm, an Arduino Nano 33 BLE microcontroller (which has a built-in IMU), and several external sensors that capture user input.

## Hardware Components

### Niryo One Robot

#### Description

The **Niryo One** is a 6-axis collaborative robotic arm. It is powered by ROS (Robot Operating System) and allows for advanced programming and control.

#### Specifications

- **Degrees of Freedom**: 6
- **Payload**: Up to 0.5 kg
- **Reach**: 440 mm
- **Weight**: 3kg
- **Repeatabillity**: 3kg
- **Software Compatibility**: ROS, Python APIs
- **End Effectors**: Gripper, vacuum pump, electromagnet (the gripper is used in this project)

#### Role in the Project

The Niryo One serves as the physical prosthetic arm, executing movements based on sensor input. It mimics the natural motion of a human arm by responding to real-time data from the sensors.

### Arduino Nano 33 BLE

#### Description

The **Arduino Nano 33 BLE** is a compact microcontroller board featuring Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity and an onboard IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit).

#### Features

- **Microcontroller**: nRF52840 (ARM Cortex-M4 CPU)
- **Operating Voltage**: 3.3V
- **Digital I/O Pins**: 14
- **Analog Input Pins**: 8
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth 5.0 BLE
- **Built-in Sensor**: 9-axis IMU (LSM9DS1)

#### Role in the Project

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE collects data from its built-in IMU and connected external sensors (potentiometer and flex sensor), sending this data to the control software running on a computer, which then commands the Niryo One robot.


#### Potentiometer

##### Description

A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider.

##### How It's Used

- **Manual Control**: Allows the user to adjust the position of a specific joint on the robot manually.
- **Data Output**: Provides variable resistance translated into position values for the robot's joint.

### Sensor

#### Flex Sensor

##### Description

A flex sensor changes its resistance based on the amount it is bent.

##### How It's Used

- **Gripper Control**: Bending the flex sensor controls the opening and closing of the robot's gripper.
- **Data Output**: Resistance values correspond to the degree of bend, which are mapped to gripper positions.

### Connections and Wiring

#### Schematic Diagrams

*Please insert diagrams here if available.*

#### Pin Connections

- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**

  - **Built-in IMU**: No wiring required; accessible via code.
  - **Potentiometer**:
    - **VCC**: Connect to 3.3V
    - **GND**: Connect to Ground
    - **Signal**: Connect to an analog input pin (e.g., A0)
  - **Flex Sensor**:
    - **One End**: Connect to 3.3V through a pull-up resistor (e.g., 10kÎ©)
    - **Other End**: Connect to GND


## Power Supply

### Requirements

- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**: Powered via USB (5V from the computer).
- **Niryo One Robot**: Requires its own power supply (24V DC, provided with the robot).

### Safety Considerations

- Ensure all devices are powered according to their specifications.
- Avoid short circuits by double-checking connections.
- Disconnect power before making changes to the wiring.

## Maintenance

- **Regularly Inspect Connections**

  - Ensure all wires and connections are secure.
  - Look for signs of wear or damage on sensors and cables.

- **Update Software**

  - Keep the Arduino firmware and control software up to date.
  - Update the Niryo One firmware as per the manufacturer's recommendations.
