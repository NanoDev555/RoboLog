## Overview

The RoboLog project aims to develop a prosthetic arm controlled through various sensor inputs to mimic natural human movements. The hardware setup includes a Niryo One robotic arm, an Arduino Nano 33 BLE microcontroller, and several sensors that capture user input.

## Hardware Components

### Niryo One Robot

#### Description

The **Niryo One** is a 6-axis collaborative robotic arm designed for education and research. It is powered by ROS (Robot Operating System) and allows for advanced programming and control.

#### Specifications

- **Degrees of Freedom**: 6
- **Payload**: Up to 0.5 kg
- **Reach**: 440 mm
- **Software Compatibility**: ROS, Python APIs
- **End Effectors**: Gripper, vacuum pump, electromagnet (the gripper is used in this project)

#### Role in the Project

The Niryo One serves as the physical prosthetic arm, executing movements based on sensor input. It mimics the natural motion of a human arm by responding to real-time data from the sensors.

### Arduino Nano 33 BLE

#### Description

The **Arduino Nano 33 BLE** is a compact microcontroller board featuring Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity and an onboard IMU.

#### Features

- **Microcontroller**: nRF52840 (ARM Cortex-M4 CPU)
- **Operating Voltage**: 3.3V
- **Digital I/O Pins**: 14
- **Analog Input Pins**: 8
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth 5.0 BLE
- **Sensors**: 9-axis IMU (LSM9DS1)

#### Role in the Project

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE collects data from the connected sensors (IMU, potentiometer, flex sensor) and sends this data to the control software running on a computer, which then commands the Niryo One robot.

### Sensors

#### Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)

##### Description

The IMU is a 9-axis sensor combining an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, allowing for motion tracking and orientation detection.

##### How It's Used

- **Motion Capture**: Detects the orientation and movement of the user's limb.
- **Data Output**: Provides roll, pitch, and yaw angles used to control corresponding joints on the Niryo One.

#### Potentiometer

##### Description

A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider.

##### How It's Used

- **Manual Control**: Allows the user to adjust the position of a specific joint on the robot manually.
- **Data Output**: Provides variable resistance translated into position values for the robot's joint.

#### Flex Sensor

##### Description

A flex sensor changes its resistance based on the amount it is bent.

##### How It's Used

- **Gripper Control**: Bending the flex sensor controls the opening and closing of the robot's gripper.
- **Data Output**: Resistance values correspond to the degree of bend, which are mapped to gripper positions.

### Connections and Wiring

#### Schematic Diagrams

*Please insert diagrams here if available.*

#### Pin Connections

- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**

  - **IMU**: Built-in, connected internally.
  - **Potentiometer**:
    - **VCC**: Connect to 3.3V
    - **GND**: Connect to Ground
    - **Signal**: Connect to an analog input pin (e.g., A0)
  - **Flex Sensor**:
    - **One End**: Connect to 3.3V through a pull-up resistor (e.g., 10kÎ©)
    - **Other End**: Connect to Ground
    - **Voltage Divider Point**: Connect to an analog input pin (e.g., A1)

#### Communication Interfaces

- **USB Connection**: The Arduino is connected to the computer via USB for serial communication.
- **Serial Communication**: Used to send sensor data from the Arduino to the control software on the computer.

### Power Supply

#### Requirements

- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**: Powered via USB (5V from the computer).
- **Niryo One Robot**: Requires its own power supply (24V DC, provided with the robot).

#### Safety Considerations

- Ensure all devices are powered according to their specifications.
- Avoid short circuits by double-checking connections.
- Disconnect power before making changes to the wiring.

## Setup and Assembly

1. **Assemble the Sensors**

   - **Potentiometer**: Mount it securely where it can be easily adjusted.
   - **Flex Sensor**: Attach it to a glove or a flexible surface that bends with finger movement.
   - **IMU**: Since it's built into the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, secure the Arduino to the user's limb or a representative model.

2. **Connect the Sensors to the Arduino**

   - Wire the potentiometer and flex sensor to the appropriate analog input pins.
   - Use a breadboard and jumper wires as needed.

3. **Connect the Arduino to the Computer**

   - Use a USB cable to connect the Arduino to the computer running the control software.

4. **Set Up the Niryo One Robot**

   - Place the robot on a stable surface.
   - Connect the robot to its power supply.
   - Establish a connection between the robot and the computer (via Ethernet or Wi-Fi, as per the software setup).

5. **Install Necessary Software**

   - **Arduino IDE**: For programming the Arduino.
   - **Python and Niryo One Python API**: For controlling the robot from the computer.
   - **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: If required for advanced functionalities.

6. **Upload Arduino Code**

   - Write or use existing code to read sensor data and send it over serial communication.
   - Compile and upload the code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

7. **Run Control Software**

   - On the computer, run the Python scripts that read data from the Arduino and send commands to the Niryo One robot.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Serial Communication**

  - Check USB connections.
  - Ensure the correct COM port is selected.
  - Verify baud rates match between the Arduino code and the Python script.

- **Sensor Readings Are Inaccurate**

  - Calibrate sensors if necessary.
  - Check for loose or faulty connections.
  - Replace sensors if defective.

- **Robot Not Responding**

  - Ensure the Niryo One is powered on.
  - Verify network connections between the robot and the computer.
  - Check for errors in the control software.

## Maintenance

- **Regularly Inspect Connections**

  - Ensure all wires and connections are secure.
  - Look for signs of wear or damage on sensors and cables.

- **Update Software**

  - Keep the Arduino firmware and control software up to date.
  - Update the Niryo One firmware as per the manufacturer's recommendations.

- **Clean Hardware**

  - Keep the robot and sensors free from dust and debris.
  - Use appropriate cleaning methods for electronic components.

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Sensors**

  - Integrate more advanced sensors like EMG (Electromyography) for muscle activity detection.
